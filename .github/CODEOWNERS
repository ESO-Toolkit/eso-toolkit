# CODEOWNERS - Defines code ownership for required review enforcement
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners
#
# When "Require review from Code Owners" is enabled in branch protection,
# GitHub will require an approving review from a code owner before merging.
# This prevents non-admin users from bypassing the merge queue by clicking
# the merge button directly after getting a non-owner review.

# Default owner for everything
* @ESO-Toolkit/admins

# Critical paths - any member of the admins team can approve
/.github/ @ESO-Toolkit/admins
/.github/workflows/ @ESO-Toolkit/admins

# CODEOWNERS itself - only @bkrupa can approve changes
/.github/CODEOWNERS @bkrupa

# Worker Configuration Environment Variables

# Override automatic worker detection (useful for testing different configurations)
# PLAYWRIGHT_WORKERS=3

# Memory allocation per worker in MB (default: varies by config)
# PLAYWRIGHT_MEMORY_PER_WORKER=1000

# Maximum workers regardless of CPU count (safety limit)
# PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_WORKERS=4

# Minimum workers to ensure reasonable parallelization
# PLAYWRIGHT_MIN_WORKERS=1

# Force conservative mode (overrides all calculations)
# PLAYWRIGHT_CONSERVATIVE_MODE=true

# Examples:
# For memory-constrained environments:
# PLAYWRIGHT_MEMORY_PER_WORKER=800
# PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_WORKERS=2

# For aggressive parallelization:
# PLAYWRIGHT_MEMORY_PER_WORKER=600
# PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_WORKERS=4

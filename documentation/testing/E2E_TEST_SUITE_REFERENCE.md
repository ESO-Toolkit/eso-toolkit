## 🎯 Decision Guide

### When should I run which suite?

#### Before committing code:

```powershell
# Quick validation (always run)
npm run test:smoke
```

#### Before creating a PR:

```powershell
# Quick validation + linting
npm run validate
npm run test:smoke
```

#### Before merging to main:

- ✅ Smoke tests run automatically in CI
- ⚠️ Review nightly test results from last run
- ⚠️ Consider running full suite if major changes

#### Before a release:

```powershell
# Comprehensive validation
npm run test:full
npm run test:screen-sizes
npm run test:performance

# Then check nightly results
npm run test:nightly:report
```

#### After major refactoring:

```powershell
# Full validation
npm run test:full
npm run test:nightly:all

# Consider screen sizes if layout changed
npm run test:screen-sizes
```

#### Weekly maintenance:

```powershell
# Performance monitoring
npm run test:performance

# Full regression check (optional)
npm run test:full
```

## 💡 Tips

1. **Start with smoke tests** - They're fast and catch most issues
2. **Run full suite before releases** - Catches edge cases smoke tests miss
3. **Check nightly results** - Don't re-run if nightly passed recently
4. **Use headed mode for debugging** - See what the browser is doing
5. **Use UI mode for exploring** - Interactive test exploration
6. **Review generated screen-size artifacts carefully** - They are not release assets
7. **Run performance tests in isolation** - Close other apps for accurate measurements

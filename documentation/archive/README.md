# Documentation Archive

**Purpose**: Historical documentation preserved for reference  
**Status**: These files are no longer actively maintained

---

## What's Here

This directory contains documentation that was relevant during development but is now superseded by more current implementations or no longer reflects the active codebase.

### Archived Files

#### Death Analysis Documentation

- **DEATH_ANALYSIS_REAL_DATA_STATUS.md** - Status report from when death analysis switched from mock to real data
- **DEATH_EVENTS_DEBUG_REPORT.md** - Debugging session for report 7zj1ma8kD9xn4cTq death events issue
- **DEATH_EVENTS_HOSTILITY_FIX.md** - Fix for hostility filtering in death event queries
- **ENHANCED_DEATH_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of enhanced death analysis implementation

**Context**: These files document the evolution of the death analysis feature. The functionality described is now part of the standard codebase and these status/debug reports are historical.

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

1. **Historical Context** - Understanding how features evolved
2. **Troubleshooting** - Debugging patterns that might recur
3. **Learning** - Examples of problem-solving approaches
4. **Audit Trail** - Complete project history

## When to Archive Documentation

Move documentation here when:
- ✅ Feature implementation is complete and stable
- ✅ Debug/status reports are no longer relevant
- ✅ Documentation is superseded by newer guides
- ✅ Content is historical but potentially useful for reference

**Don't archive**:
- ❌ Active feature documentation
- ❌ Current implementation guides
- ❌ Testing documentation in use
- ❌ Architecture docs for active systems
